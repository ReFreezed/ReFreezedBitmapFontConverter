# <img src="gfx/appIcon256.png" width="32" height="32"> ReFreezed Bitmap Font converter

This command line program converts a simple custom bitmap font format to AngelCode's [BMFont](http://www.angelcode.com/products/bmfont/doc/file_format.html).
There is also some basic support for rasterizing TrueType/OpenType fonts.

The ReFreezed Bitmap Font consists of two files: an image with all the glyphs
separated by a border, and a text file (descriptor) that specifies what glyphs
are in the image (but not any coordinates, unlike BMFont).

*Who is this program for?*

If you're making bitmap fonts for your game in an image editing program but
you don't have a simple way of creating BMFont files, this program could be
what you're looking for. There are other programs that focus on rasterizing
TrueType fonts into bitmaps - this program however is focusing more on
converting a more user-friendly bitmap format to the pretty well-supported
BMFont format.

This program was made as a tool for the [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/) game
framework, but if your game engine understands BMFont files then this program
may very well be useful for you.
